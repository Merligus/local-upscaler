"""Running an upscale off the GUI thread.

`engine.runner` is deliberately Qt-free, so this is the whole of the bridge: a
`QObject` that is moved onto a `QThread`, calls `Runner.run()`, and turns its
plain callbacks into signals.

The callbacks arrive on the worker thread. They are emitted as signals rather
than touching widgets directly, which is what makes that safe — a queued
connection marshals them back to the GUI thread, so the progress bar is updated
by the thread that owns it.

Cancellation goes the other way and is deliberately not a signal: `Runner.cancel`
sets a flag and calls `terminate()` on the child process, both of which are safe
to do from the GUI thread while the worker is blocked reading the engine's
stderr. Going through the event loop would not work, because the worker thread
is inside a blocking read and would not process a queued call until the run it
is meant to interrupt had already finished.
